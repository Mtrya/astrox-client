# Explanations

This directory contains conceptual documentation and theoretical background for the ASTROX library.

## Structure

- **propagation/** - Orbital propagation theories and models
- **coverage/** - Coverage analysis concepts and FOM calculations
- **access/** - Access computation position types and chain analysis
- **lighting/** - Solar intensity and lighting time calculations
- **orbit_design/** - Orbit design and constellation patterns
- **collision/** - Conjunction analysis and debris modeling
- **rocket/** - Rocket trajectory optimization

## Purpose

These documents provide:
- Theoretical background for aerospace concepts
- References to example scripts (no code blocks)
- Links to external resources (Wikipedia, papers, STK docs)

For working code examples, see the `examples/` directory.
